- can't close flash messages
- mgf can't be opened from the navbar
- sometimes not possible to switch books (depending on which pages is currently selected)
- in mgf and hw3 search doesn't work at all
- add these somewhere again:
  - `flash[:notice] = t(:nosuchentry_in_selectedbook)`
  - `flash[:notice] = t(:nosearchresults_in_selectedbook, book: t("books.#{@page.book.slug}"))`
  - `flash[:warn] = t(:nosearchresults)`
- more elegant deployment solution
- need to reduce load re sidebar updates ... perhaps best to only update it while open,
  and always close it upon pageturn or search?
