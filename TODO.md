- search is off in: hw3, lane
- search fails to produce any results other than "1" in: mgf
- can't close flash messages (not that there are many or any at the moment ... ?)
- add these somewhere again:
  - `flash[:notice] = t(:nosuchentry_in_selectedbook)`
  - `flash[:notice] = t(:nosearchresults_in_selectedbook, book: t("books.#{@page.book.slug}"))`
  - `flash[:warn] = t(:nosearchresults)`
- more elegant deployment solution
